# Solana Watchdog Agent

Autonomous Solana monitoring agent focused on network health and reliability.

This agent continuously observes Solana RPC performance, detects anomalies,
and alerts humans with contextual explanations instead of raw metrics.

## 🧠 Agent Design
This project emphasizes autonomous agent decision-making over dashboards.

The agent interprets network signals, classifies severity levels,
and decides when human intervention is necessary.

See `agent.md` for detailed agent logic and behavior.
